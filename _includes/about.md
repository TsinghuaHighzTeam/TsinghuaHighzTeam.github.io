# THU High-z Team(THT)
High-z galaxy team is a new team in DOA Tsinghua University. We now have three members:

**Faculty**: Zheng Cai, interested in extragalactic Astronomy and Cosmology. Specifically, Zheng is developing a novel technique that is designed to pinpoint the most massive protoclusters at z=2-3 by utilizing intergalactic neutral hydrogen absorption.In addition, Zheng is leading a number of other projects that include studying the early metal enrichment of intergalactic medium (IGM) at z=4-6; constraining the Population III stars in galaxies at z=7; and probing the quasar host galaxies at z=2-3.

 **Phd Students**:
	
	1. Shiwu Zhang, interested in CGM, Lyman-alpha nebulae, galaxy gas accretion mode,AGN feedback

	2. Yunjing Wu, interested in observation of high-z QSOs, using ALMA data.
