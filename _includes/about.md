# ABOUT
   High-z galaxy team is a new team in DOA Tsinghua University. We now have three members:  
**Faculty**:   
   [Zheng Cai](http://sancerre.as.arizona.edu/~caiz/Home/Welcome.html), interested in extragalactic Astronomy and Cosmology. Specifically, Zheng is developing a novel technique that is designed to pinpoint the most massive protoclusters at z=2-3 by utilizing intergalactic neutral hydrogen absorption.In addition, Zheng is leading a number of other projects that include studying the early metal enrichment of intergalactic medium (IGM) at z=4-6; constraining the Population III stars in galaxies at z=7; and probing the quasar host galaxies at z=2-3.  
   
**Postdoc**:
   Haibin Zhang, Study the origin of Lyman-alpha blob.
