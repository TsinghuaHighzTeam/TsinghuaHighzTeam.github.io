## Tsinghua High-z Team

Welcome to the website of Tsinghua High-z Team! Our team is part of Department of Astronomy(DOA) in Tsinghua University Beijing. We mainly focus on the high-z galaxies and quasars. Here are the details.
* Mapping the Most Massive Overdensity Through Hydrogen (Zheng Cai).
* Study the origin of Lyman-alpha blob (Haibin Zhang).
* Study the CGM environment and gas kinematics of high-z galaxies (Shiwu Zhang, Zheng Cai).
* Find the high-z quasars and absorbers (Yunjing Wu, Zheng Cai).
* Study the cold gas environment of high-z galaxies with ALMA (Jianrui Li, Zheng Cai).
* Find the DLA from the quasar spectra prepared for DESI (Ben Wang, Jiaqi Zou and Zheng Cai).
* CMB lensing (Xiaojing Lin, Zheng Cai)
* Fitting the quasar continuum (Zechang Sun, Zheng Cai)
* Lyman-alpha tomography (Zihao Li, Zheng Cai)
We now have several members:
 * Zheng Cai, assistant professor in DOA, Hubble fellow.
 * haibin Zhang, postdoc, graduated from the university of Tokyo.
 * Shiwu Zhang, graduate stundent (third year)
 * Yunjing Wu, graduate student (second year)
 * Jianrui Li, graduate student (second year)
 * Ben Wang, graduate student (first year)
 * Jiaqi Zou, graduate student (first year)
 * Xiaojing Lin, undergraduate student
 * Zechang Sun, undergraduate student
 * Mingyu Li, undergraduate student
